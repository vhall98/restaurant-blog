This is a Restaurant Review App that allows users to register for new account and post reviews or comments or search for restaurant reviews

The main section of the Web page contains a list of the user logged in reviews. They appear with the newest one first, showing the title, the body, and information on the posting date and the poster. The title is a link, which allows visitors to go to the page for the review, which shows the full review and all of the comments posted about it. The review's page also provides a form for visitors to post their own comments about it.

The right side of the main Web page contains a separate content area that displays news articles, providing information relevant to the site's topic, such as restaurant openings and menu changes.
